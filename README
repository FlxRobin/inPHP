inPHP is a declarative reflective performance oriented MVC framework with built-in ORM
v0.1 This version is an early testing alpha. Don't use on production machines without thorough testing

This framework can be used full-stack framework for handling web requests(1), executing shell scripts(2)
and as glue framework library(3) incorporated in somethingelse entirely.

1 Basic usage
1.1 Handling web requests
To use inPHP to handle web requests, a webserver has to serve inPHP.php. If you want the urlrouting to
work, you have to setup the webserver to forward a whole range of requests to inPHP.php
This can be done by urlrewriting found in almost all major webservers.
When urlrewriting works, the controller used by the framework to handle the request becomes dynamic,
'somesite.com/Foo.html' is handled by an IController implementation named Foo, that IController
is passed all slash-seperated arguments between its name and the extension of the url:
'somesite.com/Foo/arg1/arg2.html' => Foo->main(array(arg1, arg2));

1.2 Executing shell scripts
inPHP can act as an entry point for shell scripts using the framework. 
The command 'php inPHP.php \\inPHP\\Control\\SomeScript' instantiates inPHP\Control\SomeScript and
calls run() with all the arguments passed after its own name (none in this case).
The double slashes are the result of PHP using an escape character as its namespace seperator.
One IRunnable shell script is included by default:
'php inPHP.php \\inPHP\\Control\\Help \\inPHP\\Control\\SomeScript' would show the documentation
of SomeScript, which could be usefull for looking up arguments of a script.

1.3 Glue framework library
inPHP can also be used as a bunch of classes, especially the ORM can be very usefull outside of the
fullstack usage. Using it as glue is very simple, just include the inPHP.php in another php file,
that way it won't execute (this trick works so long as you don't name the called script inPHP.php). It
will just define a bunch of classes, allowing you to use those parts you find usefull. Note: it will
install an autoload function.

2 Functionality
2.1 Controllers
'Showing a list of cats', 'Adding a cat' we call such things 'actions'; controllers
have the end responsiblity for 'doing' such actions.
A request-url will map to an controller and arguments pass to it. For example:
/ListCat/tiger.html => (new ListCat())->main(array('tiger'));
For their task, Controllers instantiate and use Models to acces the persistance layer 
and Views to create a presentable response.
Making such a controller is easy, just implement inPHP\Control\IController, or extend 
inPHP\ControlController. The request url won't contain any namespace information,
so all controllers must live in the same namespace, specified by Conf::set('App.controlSpace');

2.2 Models
An instance of a model represents information in the persistence layer of the application,
usualy the database.
Models are supplied with metadata about how to translate them to records, this happens
by adding annotations to the doccomments.
This metadata includes primary keys and relations with other models.
To create Model, you can implement IModel or extend Model. All models are required to have
at least one property with a PrimaryKey annotation see (2.4).

2.3 Views
Views in this framework are generally generated and not hand writter by the user; they are
derived from the model, by allowing view-related metadata to be added to the model.
The Controller only has to deal with (parametirized by model) View Generators.
Adding view-related metadata to the model classes could be considered a breach with MVC,
it could also be viewed as Aspect Oriented Programming defining Viewing as an aspect, 
or it could be viewed as pragmatic webprogramming.

2.4 Annotations
inPHP is a declarative framework, it uses annotations that can supply classes with
meta information usefull in Aspect Oriented Programming. One of the main users of these declarations
is the ORM. Since PHP doesn't support annotations in any other way, we write ours in DocComments. 
This framework has its own annotation parser, which is really simple and looks a lot
like PHP. in fact @SomeModel('something'); just gets translated to 'new SomeModel('something')';
Annotations start with @, end with ; and are supposed to have a constructor call without new 
between them.
Most classes however live in namespaces, so to annotate a property as primary key, we use
@inPHP\ORM\PrimaryKey;
Because annotations are in DocComments, they can apply to anything that PHP's reflection can
get the DocComment for, including classes. But annotating classes can be substituted
with implementing interfaces; because that will be much faster to reflect, however, if the interface
is lazy loaded, it will require one more fileread when parsing the class, so when parsing of the class
is more important than reflecting, use annotations for classes too. For methods and properties
annotations can not be substituted by an already existing language feature.

2.5 ORM
2.5.1 Model declaration
To classify as Model, a class has to implement IModel, the easiest way to do this is to extend
Model. Once you've extended Model, you need to define properties as protected (so Model can acces
them) and annotate them appropriatly.
At least one of those properties has to become the primary key; we use annotations to mark a property
as primarykey: /** @inPHP\ORM\PrimaryKey; */ protected $name;
All properties will also have something called a MetaType, this is a type that vaguely defines the 
type of the property in a sort of abstract way. The default MetaType is a inPHP\ORM\String which
translate to varchar(255) in a MySQL database; to override this MetaType simple annotate the property
with another MetaType, like inPHP\ORM\Integer, inPHP\ORM\FloatingPoint or inPHP\ORM\Bool.
/** @inPHP\ORM\Integer */ protected $count;
These are all simple scalar MetaTypes, but MetaType don't have to be simple, a Model is also
a MetaType, and using it translates to a foreign reference in a table. You don't have to worry
about the foreign class having multiple PK property, the framework gets all of them, and stores
them in an object of the foreign class.
Example class:
class SomeModel extends Model {
	/** @inPHP\ORM\PrimaryKey; @inPHP\ORM\Integer; */
	protected $id;
	/** @SomeSpace\Model\AnotherModel; */
	protected $another;	// when queried, will be populated by a model of that class.
}
See also inPHP\ORM\Many, inPHP\ORM\Enum in inPHP.php.

2.5.2 Querying models
Using the models defined earlier, we have enough information to generate queries.

Select
Queries are captured by the DQ (Data query) objects, these can translate to SQL select queries.
Function names in the DQ class match the clauses a select query, and are meant to make the creation
of such queries very compact:
DQ::select() returns a new DQ object, with all parameters passed used as fields.
on this DQ object, we can also call where(), groupBy(), having(), orderBy(), all will have 
all arguments passed to them used as the appropriate values in the DQ.
MF stands for ModelField, it is a field that exists as one property in the model, but may exists
as multiple attributes in the datastore, a foreign reference to a Model with a composite key would
be one model property, but will have multiple attributes to point to that foreign table.
To initiate an MF with a specific name, just do MF::name();
DQ::select(MF::name()); would result in a query with name in the SELECT clause.

Where
The where clause does not need just fields, it want predicates, or filters, here QF comes in.
A QF or QueryFilter captures a filter, it translates as follows: QF[a, op, b] => a op b
To ease creation, they can be created of their own 'a' MF::name()->filter('=', 0);
will result in a QF[a:name, op:=, b:0] => name = 0.
So DQ::select($n = MF::name())->where($n->filter('=', 0);
You may have noted there is yet to be something to fill in the WHERE clause; thats because it
usualy gets set automaticly.

Data Acces Object
A Data Acces Object, DAO is an object glueing Models to a Datastore; a model does not understand
what a datastore is, but the DAO does, and therefore the DAO sets the source (or FROM clause) in
the DQ. To get a DAO, use the following: $dao = DAO::ModelName(); This works by a Visiting Factory,
by as long as you just extend Model, you don't need to worry about that.
Its the DAO that we give our queries to, and then it will return something.
$fetcher = $dao->query(DQ::select());
The variable is called fetcher, and not list, vector or anything like that, thats because the dao
return a callback, a callback which takes another callback (which we can define) to do anything
usefull with the result:
$fetcher(function ($model, $record) { print_r($model); });
It is obvious why it didn't return a list, this way we only have one record in memory, and
don't at all have to build and then walk through lists.
Note: future versions will likely provide an object which is both Invokable and Iteratable.
See also inPHP\ORM\SF, inPHP\ORM\DSFunc, inPHP\ORM\LeftJoin, inPHP\ORM\DAO::join in inPHP.php.

2.5.3 LRS Generation
After all that metadata has been added as annotations to the Model classes, we can now generate
the LRS that this ORM expects to see in the Database, and thats why inPHP\ORM\LRSGenerator was
added as an extension. Its an IRunnable script. 
It can be called with 'php inPHP.php \\inLogic\\ORM\\LRSGenerator' 
All extra args passed are meant to be either files to included (with model definitions), or
the argument --apply, which makes the script not just print the LRS, but apply it to the DB.
